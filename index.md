We are a community of IT students that meet to further develop our skills and make ourselves ready for the workplace post-graduation.


We have a [constitution here](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/0/code_of_conduct/) that outlines what we are about.

We currently adopt the contributers covenant version 2.0 as our code of conduct.
